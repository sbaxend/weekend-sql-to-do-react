## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This is an application that helps you keep track of tasks you need to get done throughout the day, week, or month.
You can start by adding the a task with the form at top of website with the task name, and then choosing task date of your choice. You
dont have to choose a date, although it will automatically be for the day you enter it in. You can also add in notes about what you need to exactly do with the task as an option. Upon submission, it will add the task to the list while display a completion status and delete button. Clicking on the circle next to the task will set the status to complete and you can click it again to reset it back to 
incomplete. When you are done with a task fully you can delete by pressing the delete button. This will completly remove it from everything.

I solved this project by first writing out a list of actions I wanted to see implemented into this project.
I started by having a parent component and built up my code to make sure each function worked properly all together.
After, I seperated all the main functions into their own components file and used props to share data between the components file.
